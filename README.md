# University-Projects
This repository describes some of my learning progress and homeworks @ FMI. If you are interested to know more about each project I have provided info in alphabetical order.

## Asylym 
Asylym is Java Swing Desktop app that allows you the manage an asylym-inspired system with its patients.  
- built with h2 database.   
- has three entities - Patients, Psychologies and Departments - you can perform crud operations on all of them and to search by different criterias.
  
## Cars Manager  
Cars Manager is an ASP.net app with and MVC website and WCF SOAP Service Application that I build during my distributed web applications course.  
- has three entities - Cars, Makes, Types and each Car has a Make and Type.  
- may be tested with WcfTestClient   

## C# OOP, Algorithms and Data Structures  
This repository contains my homeworks during my OOP and algorithms courses. Mostly console apps and win forms.
- **Personal Id**  => small program that validates inserted Bulgarian personal identification number
- **Calculator**  => WPF app that supports many operations, has memory buttons and history of operations implemented 
- **Product Inventory (Mr.Robot Store)**  => console app that manages multiple products from a Mr.Robot themed "store". you may add products to inventory, add stock to an existing product, calculate the total value of a product and the total value of the entire inventory. 
- **Prison Break** => A randomly generated labyrinth (prison) is given along with a prisoner's starting position. The labyrinth has three kinds of fields - empty, door and wall. The prisoner can pass freely through the empty fields and the doors, but not through the walls. The prisoner cannot move diagonally, only up/down/left/right 1 field at a time. Zize of the labyrinth is 5 <= n <= 20, where n is the number of columns and rows. The task was to find a path and then to print the coordinates of the blocking doors.  
- **Pipes** => There is a system of pipes. Water enters the system from the first pipe with a given litres/second. After the first pipe, the system starts to branch and each pipe, if it branches, branches out exactly into two smaller pipes. A percentage of water goes into the left branch and the remaining percentage - into the right. The sum of percentages for the left branch and right branch of a given pipe is, of course, 100. We had to implement that as some kind of algorithm that follows this rule :  
You get from the console input: `<water that enters the first pipe in liters/second> <the number of all pipes>`  and on separate rows after that `<number of the pipe> <number of left branch> <percentage for left branch> <number of right branch> <percentage for right branch>`  
- **Diamonds Domino** => A company decided to create special domino sets, where the dots on each side of a bone are not just from 0 to 6, but from 0 to n. The same principles from regular domino apply for this new type of domino. Each bone has two ends. On each there are several dots, from 0 up to n. A set of domino contains all possible combinations of ends. No two bones are the same. There is no distinction when it comes to left and right, which means that the bones 5-3 and 3-5 are considered the same. One more thing – instead of regular painted dots, thе bones in this special set are marked with diamonds. How many diamonds are needed to make one special domino set? => I solved that following a simple arithmetic progression logic.
